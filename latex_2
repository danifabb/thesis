\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

\subsection{Photosynthesis}

Photosynthesis is the basis of the ecosystem food chain and “the ultimate source of all of humankind’s food and oxygen” (Johnson, 2016). Oxygenic photosynthesis is a process that allows certain organisms, including plants, to harvest solar energy to synthesize organic compounds, starting from carbon dioxide and water and generating oxygen as well (Arnon, 1971): 

\begin{equation}
   6H_2O + 6CO_2 + light \rightarrow C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2
    \label{eq:photosynthesis}
\end{equation}

The photosynthetic processes described here concern C3 plants and not C4 and CAM plants, which mostly live in tropical climates and have a different anatomy and different photosynthetic strategies.
\smallskip

Photosynthesis mostly takes place in the leaves. Figure \ref{fig:leaf} shows the typical anatomy of a leaf. Different cell types in the leaf contribute to the photosynthetic process: CO2 entry is controlled by stomata in the lower epidermis, photosynthetic parenchyma (mesophyll) cells contain many chloroplasts and are the principal center of photosynthesis, whereas vascular tissues transport the sap with the necessary compounds into the leaves (xylem), or towards the rest of the plant (phloem) (Mauseth J., 2006). 
\smallskip

A leaf contains a waxy cuticle, epidermal cells on its upper and lower surface, two types of mesophyll (palisade parenchyma and spongy parenchyma) and transport tissues (xylem and phloem) which are present in the vascular bundle. Figure from Diah et al., 2014.}
    \label{fig:leaf}
\end{figure}

The site of photosynthesis in the cell is the chloroplast, an organelle with two outer membranes and one thylakoid membrane. The latter divides the chloroplast into two spaces: the stroma on the outside and the lumen on the inside. 
% chloroplast image?
In plants, photosynthesis can be divided into two phases: 

\begin{itemize}

\item A first light-dependent phase that happens in the thylakoid membrane. It results in the production of adenosine triphosphate (high-energy compound) and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (high reducing power). The energy of light is thus converted into chemical energy.

\item A second metabolic phase that happens in the stroma. Here, ATP and NAD(P)H are used by the enzymes of the Calvin-Benson cycle and CO2 gets reduced and fixed into carbohydrates (Johnson, 2016). ATP and NADPH provide the 479 kJ that are necessary for photosynthesis to occur, as it is an endergonic process (Antal et al., 2013). 

\end{itemize}

The first phase of photosynthesis requires pigments, which in plant cells are mainly chlorophyll a and b, i. e. molecules with a ring structure similar to porphyrin (Quieroz et al., 2017). When chlorophyll absorbs photons at certain wavelengths - mostly the blue (425–450 nm) and red parts (600–700 nm) of the visible spectrum -, it reaches an excited, unstable state {that cannot be maintained for long}. As the excited molecule goes back to its ground state, the extra energy can be disposed of through energy transfer to a neighboring molecule, which in turn becomes excited (Rascio et al. 2017). This is the process that happens in photosystems I and II, two complexes that can be found in the thylakoid membrane. They are formed by hundreds of pigment molecules that collect and transfer energy to a reaction center, called P680 in photosystem I and P700 in Photosystem II. Two chlorophylls in the reaction center behave differently than other pigments in the complex: instead of transferring energy, one of them undergoes oxidation, transferring an electron to the other and thus making a redox chain possible (Johnson, 2016). 
\smallskip

The electron transport chain (Figure \ref{fig:light}) involves a series of molecules that are present in the thylakoid membrane, ending with ferredoxin/ NADP+ reductase (FNR). This pathway is unidirectional, as electrons are transferred from stronger reductants to weaker ones (Arnon, 1971). As a result of the electron chain, NAPD+ is reduced to NADPH, whereas water reduces oxidized P680 back to its former state and is therefore converted to oxygen. The electron chain also causes proton transport across the membrane, with an accumulation of protons in the lumen. This gradient is used by the ATP synthase to generate ATP through phosphorylation. (Hill and Bendall, 1960 + Johnson, 2016). 

\begin{figure}[H]

    \label{fig:light}
\end{figure}

After the light-dependent reactions, there is a metabolic phase: CO2 is fixed into organic compounds during the Calvin-Benson cycle, which is made up of 13 reactions. Primary $CO_2$ assimilation is catalyzed by the enzyme RuBisCO (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/ oxygenase), when the sugar ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate undergoes carboxylation. The first three reactions lead to the formation of two molecules of a triose phosphate called glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), thanks to the previously produced ATP and NADPH, which provide energy and reducing power. The other ten reactions aim at regenerating RuBP so that it can be used in the next cycle (Biel \& Fomina, 2015). In total, the cycle uses 3 molecules of ATP and 2 of NADPH to assimilate one $CO_2$ molecule (Rascio, 2017). 
\smallskip

When three $CO_2$ are fixed into six G3P molecules, five of these molecules become a part of the cycle again, by being regenerated into RuBP; the sixth molecule is the product that is converted into other compounds, such as sucrose and starch (Johnson, 2016).

% something about experiments with gas exchange?

\subsection{Water potential and xylem transport}
In 1958, researcher Ralph Slatyer defined water potential as “the energy that is necessary, per unit of volume, to move water from an initial point to a reference point”. Nowadays, it is often defined as a "measure of the free energy of water per unit volume (J $m^{-3}$)", relative to pure water in reference conditions (Taiz \& Zeiger, 2002). This concept can be expressed with equation \ref{eq:water}:

\begin{equation}
 \psi_{H_{2}O} = \mu_{H_2O}/V_{H_2O},  
 \label{eq:water}
\end{equation}

where $\mu$ is the chemical potential of water (Rascio, 2017). 
Water potential is made up of different components, which can be summarized with another equation (\ref{eq:potential}):

\begin{equation}
    \psi_{H_2O} = \psi_s + \psi_p + \psi_g
    \label{eq:potential}
\end{equation}

 $\psi_g$ is the gravity component, which has a minor role in small plants. $\psi_p$ is hydrostatic pressure. $\psi{H_2O}$ gets higher as $\psi_p$ and pressure increase. Osmotic potential ($\psi_s$) describes the effect of solutes on $\psi{H_2O}$. It becomes more negative as solutes accumulate in a plant cell, causing the water potential to also decrease. The presence of a water potential gradient causes water to move from higher to lower values (Taiz \& Zeiger, 2002). This concept is fundamental to explain sap transport inside the plant, which is made possible by a pressure gradient ($\delta\psi_p$) (Rascio, 2017). 

Sap (water and minerals) is absorbed by the roots and then travels inside a vascular tissue, the xylem, throughout the root system, the stem and the leaves. (qui aggiungerò due parole sullo xilema). The roots can contribute directly to this absorption by generating a ($\delta\psi_{H_2O}$) between soil and root, which is caused by an osmotic gradient. As ions accumulate in the xylem, $\psi_s$ increases, and $\psi_{H_2O}$ decreases, allowing water to flow in (Gambetta et al., 2017) . 
The main force that drives sap transport, however, is a pressure gradient (($\delta\psi_p$) between leaves and roots, as the cohesion-tension theory claims.  According to this theory, water in the xylem behaves like a cohesive, unbroken column that can ascend from roots to leaves because it is driven by evapotranspiration. Evaporation happens inside pores of leaf cell walls. Because of the hydrophilic elements in the cell wall, as the water evaporates, the meniscus becomes more concave. The concavity of the water-air interfaces inside the mesophyll cell walls creates a negative pressure (water potential), which propages to neighboring areas, creating the driving force necessary to pull water from the soil to the evaporation site (Brown, 2013).

\subsection{Stomata}
% stomata: can be influenced by both photosynthesis and w pot

\subsection{The phloem}
\subsubsection{Structure and function}
The phloem is a tissue that allows long-distance transport (translocation) of photosynthates, i. e. the product of photosynthesis. Redistribution of water and other compounds is another one of its functions. Photosynthates must be transported from their source, typically mature leaves, to areas of growth that are unable to produce enough assimilates, such as young leaves, fruits, or roots. Storage organs, including roots, tubers and rhizomes, can be both sink, when accumulating nutrients, and source, when providing said nutrients to the plant body during winter or other stress-inducing times (Taiz \& Zeiger, 2002). Seeds do the same, transitioning from source to sink when they germinate and need to consume the resources that they accumulated as starch to support the new plant’s growth (Rascio et al., 2017).
\smallskip

In Angiosperms, which are the main object of research on the phloem, xylem and phloem form vascular tissues that extend throughout the plant body, with the xylem being usually closer to the centre of the stem (or the root), and the phloem on the outer side (Taiz \& Zeiger, 2002). The two continuously exchange water. %specify primary vs secondary growth? 
\smallskip

The phloem is made up of living cells belonging to three different categories: sieve elements, companion cells and parenchymatic cells. In Angiosperms, sieve elements are roughly cylinder-shaped cells that are stacked on top of each other, forming a sieve tube (Rascio et al., 2017). Cross walls separating the cells are perforated by pores (Figure \ref{fig:sieve}), forming sieve plates, to achieve symplastic continuity and a higher hydraulic conductance inside the tube (Peters \& Knoblauch, 2022). As sieve cells do not possess a nucleus, a cytoskeleton and other essential organelles, each sieve cell is associated with one or more companion cells. Plasmodesmata provide a close symplastic relationship between sieve cells and companion cells. The latter have intense metabolic activity and are responsible for the survival of the sieve cells. They also contribute to the transport of photosynthates from mesophyll cells in leaves, where they are produced, to sieve cells (Rascio et al., 2017).

    \caption{\textit{Hypocotyl of Cucurbita maxima. Electron micrograph of a longitudinal section of two sieve tube elements. The pores of the sieve plate are visible between the two elements. The inset shows sieve plate pores. Image taken from Taiz \& Zeiger, 2002}}
    \label{fig:sieve}
\end{figure}

Phloem sap is rich in sucrose, varying from 0.3 to 0.9 M in concentration. In addition to sucrose, the phloem of certain plant families also contains high concentrations of sugar alcohols like mannitol and carbohydrates like raffinose and stachyose. Other solutes in lower concentrations include amino acids, hormones, proteins and inorganic solutes (Taiz \& Zeiger, 2002). 
\smallskip

Long-distance transport in the phloem is usually explained by the pressure-flow hypothesis, formulated by Ernst Münch in the 1920s. The hypothesis states that mass flow of water and solutes in the phloem is driven by an osmotically induced pressure gradient between source and sink organs (Figure \ref{fig:munch}). The loading of photosynthates into the sieve elements at the source causes a low osmotic potential ($\Psi_s$), which in turn causes a negative water potential ($\Psi_w$), so that water is drawn into the phloem from neighboring xylem tissue \textbf{and thus increase the turgor pressure near the source}. The opposite phenomenon happens in the sink organs, where photoassimilates are unloaded from the sieve elements and water potential becomes more positive, leading water to leave the phloem as well and the turgor pressure to decrease. This difference in turgor pressure ($\Delta P$), which is higher at the source and lower at the sink, pushes the fluid along the phloem from source to sink (Knoblauch et al, 2016).

    \caption{\textit{Relationship between xylem and phloem.

    \label{fig:munch}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Source-sink interrelationship}
Doing experiments on the phloem can be difficult, which is why it has been called “the least understood plant tissue”. Usually, experiments have to be done on whole plants, as you cannot detach source tissues from sink tissues without stopping the sap flow.  % rich tissue in resources, it will be attacked by predators/ parasites, etc. so: protection mechanisms are very strong; plant isolates the sensor you put in (seal off sensor).1 species Ricinus does not do that. Slightly toxic. For most plants you need indirect methods (labeling or measuring what comes out - proxy). Few methods that are expensive. Also, it is soft, difficult to take samples. 
Even the Münch hypothesis needs further testing, especially on the issue of sieve tubes conductance being high enough to allow pressure flow (Knoblauch et al, 2016). % not that relevant, maybe
\smallskip

Another area of interest is source-sink interrelationship, which is particularly useful for a deeper understanding of carbon allocation, defined as the regulation of the distribution of carbon among various pathways (accumulation, transport, metabolism). Starch is the main molecule that plants use for accumulation, functioning as an energy and carbon reserve, as opposed to as sucrose, which is mostly used for transport (Taiz \& Zeiger, 2002). It has been known for a long time that plants are able to adjust their starch and sucrose production according to different conditions. For example, if all but one leaf of soybean are shaded for 8 days, the source leaf experiences an increase in the rate of net photosynthesis, a decrease in starch concentration and an increase in sucrose concentration (Thorne \& Koller, 1974). % this last part is not essential
\smallskip

% acclimation to changing source–sink relationships
Carbon allocation is influenced by communication between source and sink, namely a decreased sink demand can lead to a decrease in the speed of phloem transport and to limitations in source organ activity (Taiz \& Zeiger, 2002). This ensures better coordination among source photosynthetic activity, phloem translocation and sink organ demand. 
\smallskip

Decreased sink demand can happen, for example, if a plant undergoes defruiting, or if its roots are cooled. In the first case, sink size (the total biomass of sink tissue) is reduced, in the second case sink activity (rate of uptake of photosynthates)  is limited. %find info on temperature and growth
Sink size and sink activity co-regulate sink strength, the ability of the sink organ to import photoassimilates (Balasubramanian et al., 2023).
\smallskip 

Communication between source and sink can happen through various means, including transport sugars themselves. According to this model, decreased sink demand causes high sucrose levels in the phloem, which in turn cause down-regulation of phloem loading at the source. Thus, carbohydrates accumulate in the source (mesophyll cells), which can lead to downregulation of photosynthesis (Chiou \& Bush, 1998). Generally speaking, low sugar levels cause higher photosynthetic activity, reserve mobilization and transport towards sink organs, whereas high sugar concentration encourages growth and storage, as summarized by Figure (\ref{fig:sugar}) (Rolland et al., 2002).   


\begin{figure}[H]

\graphicspath{ {./images/} }
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{images/Source-sink.png}
    \caption{Effects of sugar on source-sink activity. Image taken from Rolland et al., 2002.}
    \label{fig:sugar}
\end{figure}


% Source-sink relationship can be explored by applying a variety of treatments, such as girdling and defruiting, to plants, and can have applications in agriculture as well, if fruits are the sink organs being studied (probably cut this).
Several studies have been performed over the years about the relationship between sink demand and photosynthetic activity. For example, in Frank et. al, 2006, the authors girdled \textit{Coffea arabica} branches at their base, that is to say they removed a ring of phloem to create a closed system environment. They subsequently measured total soluble sugar concentration ($SSC_m$) and maximal leaf net $CO_2$ assimilation rate $A_{max}$ on the mature leaves of the girdled branches. The results showed that $A_{max}$ was negatively correlated to $SSC_m$, that it was higher in branches with higher fruit loads and that it decreased during the day. A conclusion was drawn that there was sink feedback down-regulating photosynthesis \textit{e.g.} low fruit loads demanded less photosynthates, therefore photosynthetic activity decreased. It is thought that the feedback is mediated by the accumulation of sugars in the leaf phloem, which inhibits phloem loading. 
\smallskip

A similar experiment (Da Matta et al., 2007) on coffee involved 4 different treatments: 
\begin{itemize}
\item complete defruiting and maintenance of the full leaf area
\item half crop load and full leaf area
\item full crop load and full leaf area
\item full crop load and half leaf area. 
\end{itemize}
The first treatment resulted in the lowest net photosynthetic rate (\textit{A}) and stomatal conductance (\textit{g}), the third treatment had the highest \textit{A} and \textit{g}, while the other two treatments had intermediate results. However, here a different conclusion is proposed: the decreased \textit{A} in the first treatment is thought to be caused not by direct sink feedback, but by the lower stomatal conductance, as (\textit{A}) and (\textit{g}) were correlated. The reason for the lower \textit{g} remains unknown.
% maybe add another paper or two with similar experiment (with peach and/or apple trees)

From a genetic perspective, carbon accumulation in leaves has been connected to changes in transcription of genes that encode photosystems I and II and to a general decreased expression of photosynthetic genes (Paul and Foyer, 2001). % this could be cut out

Other than fruits, roots can also be studied as sink organs down-regulating photosynthesis, as this thesis will investigate.

\subsection{\textit{Betula pendula}}
\textit{Betula pendula}, or European white birch, is a deciduous tree with white bark, drooping outer branches and an average height of 25 m (Vakkari P., 2009). Leaves are simple, triangular-shaped, with a dentate margin. It is a Eurosiberian tree distributed in almost all of Europe (but most abundant in Northern Europe) and many parts of Asia and North America (ref gbif website). Information on \textit{Betula pendula}'s vascular tissues (Figure \ref{fig:stem}), and on sink limitation is scarce, as studies are usually conducted on model organisms like \textit{Arabidopsis thaliana}.

\section{Aim of the thesis}
The present work was conducted in the framework of Xin Zhuang’s Doctorate research. The wider scope of the experiment was a study on the effects of sink limitation on \textit{Betula pendula} source activity and carbon translocation in the phloem (Zhuang et al., in progress). This thesis focuses on part of the results, namely the effects of sink limitation on canopy photosynthesis, the hypothesis being that decreased sink activity limits source photosynthetic activity.
\smallskip
% be clear about my results vs whole experiment
Sink activity reduction was achieved by cooling the soil around the roots of 12 saplings, while 8 other trees were left untreated to function as controls. Gas exchange variables, such as $CO_2$ net assimilation and photosynthetic efficiency, were measured with the purpose of researching how the sink limitation created by soil cooling affected leaf photosynthetic activity. 
\smallskip

I am also reporting on the results of the water status monitoring (water potential monitoring) during the experiment. Here, soil cooling is expected to cause stress for the saplings, with less root water uptake and a decrease in water potential and stomatal conductance. The stress and the lower water uptake could also contribute to a lower stomatal conductance and lower photosynthesis, which might not be exclusively a result of direct feedback from the sink (decreased sink demand). 
% is this right? we limit sink activity + side effect: hydraulic conductivity between root and soil (water has nore trouble moving from soil to xylem) - water potential measures that (references).
\smallskip
% Is it clear how source activity/ photosynthesis and translocation/ phloem transport are connected? 
% ask about stomatal/ non-stomatal conductance

\section{Materials and Methods}
Firstly, section 2.1 discusses how the experiment was set up and the conditions under which it was performed (subsection 2.1). 
\smallskip

Then, section 2.2 talks about the variables that were measured in order to study the effects of sink limitation on photosynthesis and hydraulic status of the saplings. 
\smallskip

Subsection 2.3 is a description of the statistical analysis that was conducted to achieve the results.

\subsection{Experiment setup}
I witnessed and worked on the experiment during my time as a trainee at the University of Helsinki, under the mentorship of Xin Zhuang and the supervision of Dr Yann Salmon.
\smallskip

The experiment took place at the Viikki Campus (Department of Forest Sciences, Faculty of Agriculture and Forestry), at the University of Helsinki, in a greenhouse environment, starting from 20th June 2023 and ending on 21th August of the same year. The environmental conditions in the greenhouse were 21° C and 60\% relative humidity on average. The setup involved 20 birch saplings (\textit{Betula pendula}), of approximately 3-5 years of age and 2-2.5 m tall. The trees were replanted in 20-liter pots with a mixture of forest peat and original nursery field soil, and placed in the greenhouse a week before the start of the measurements. 
\smallskip

The LAUDA thermostat (Figure \ref{fig:lauda}) was used to bring temperature down to 4 °C, with the aim of studying the effects of the cooled-down soil on photosyntetic activity and carbon translocation. The thermostat consists of a refrigeration unit and a tubing system, which was filled with anti-freeze \citep{Lauda_Dr._R._Wobser_GMBH_and_CO._KG_1989}. The silicone tubes were buried in the pots so that they were closer to the roots, cooling them more efficiently. Further insulation was achieved by putting the pots into coolbags and wrapping foam around the tubes (Figure \ref{fig:treated}).

\end{figure}

\subsection{Measurements}
Measurements were taken on five trees at a time. Every group consisted of two untreated trees (controls) and three trees that had been cooled down (treatment). The first group was measured from 30th June to 13th July; the second group was measured from 13th July to 1st August; the third group was measured from 1st August to 7th August; the fourth group was measured from 7th August to 10th August. 
\smallskip

The difference in canopy source activity and tree water status between control saplings and treated saplings was estimated through several variables. For leaf photosynthetic activity, gas exchange variables (assimilation of \(CO_2\), \(H_2 O\) evapo-transpiration, stomatal conductance, photosynthetic efficiency) were measured. For tree hydraulic status, we monitored the water potential. The instruments used during the experiment were the LI-6800 (LI-COR’s fourth generation portable photosynthesis system), a pressure chamber for water potential, and ...
%(instrument for soil temperature, name?) 
The experiment also aimed at studying the effect of soil cooling on carbon translocation and not just photosynthetic activity, which is why we used ${}^{13} C$ pulse-labeling to the canopy with the purpose of determining changes in phloem transport velocity between the control trees and the cooled trees. 
\smallskip

\subsubsection{Gas exchange}
The leaf surface loses \(H_2 O\) (evapotranspiration) and takes up \(CO_2\) (assimilation) through stomatal apertures. While the relative water vapor concentration in the leaf is greater than its concentration in the atmosphere, due to xylem activity, the opposite is true for \(CO_2\) concentration, which is lower in the leaf. These concentration gradients are maintained by stomatal resistance (licor manual). 
% theory about stomata will be in introduction, so it is not needed here
\smallskip

After burying the tubes in the pots and turning the cooling system on, we waited 2-3 days for the soil to cool down, and started measuring gas exchange with the LI-6800. This instrument (Figure \ref{fig:licor}) can measure photosynthetic processes happening at leaf-level without destroying the sample. Several leaf chambers of different dimensions are available; for this experiment, a \(6-cm^2\)-area chamber was used.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering 
\graphicspath{ {./images/} }
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth, angle=270]{images/licor_1.jpg}
    \caption{\textit{Portable Photosynthesis System closed onto birch leaf.}}
    \label{fig:licor}
\end{figure}

After the chamber is closed onto a leaf, two variables, \(CO_2\) net assimilation (\textit{A}) and \(H_2 O\) evapo-transpiration (\textit{E}), can be measured with infrared gas analysers. This is based on the difference in $CO_2$ and $H_2 O$ concentration between the air in the leaf chamber, which is affected by the leaf, and air that is not (reference). Before measuring, a reference needs to be set for \(CO_2\) concentration, humidity, temperature and light going into the chamber: for our experiment, a \(CO_2\) concentration of 400 $\mu$mol $mol^{-1}$  and 60\% relative humidity were chosen. The temperature was set at 26° C and the light was set at 500 $\mu$mol $m^{-1}s^{-1}$. 
\smallskip 

 LI-6800 measures the flow rate ($\mu$mol air $s^{-1}$) and the  \(CO_2\) and \(H_2 O\) concentrations (\textit{$\mu_0$}, \textit{$c_0$}, \textit{$w_0$} respectively) before entering the leaf chamber(Figure \ref{fig:chamber}). \(CO_2\) and water vapor concentrations (\textit{$c_a$} and \textit{$w_a$} respectively) are then measured again after coming out of the chamber. 
\smallskip

    \caption{\textit{Schematic of LI-6800 gas exchange system. Reference from (licor manual)}}
    \label{fig:chamber}
\end{figure}

\noindent While the flow rate exiting the chamber ($\mu_a$) is not directly measured, it is assumed that the water vapor released by the leaf will be added to the $\mu_0$: 
\begin{equation}
    \mu_a = \mu_0 + sE
    \label{eq:flow}
\end{equation}
where \textit{s} represents leaf area.
\smallskip

\noindent Transpiration on a leaf area basis can be calculated as: 
\begin{equation}
    sE = \mu_a w_a - \mu_0 w_0
    \label{eq:transpiration}
\end{equation}

\noindent Equation \ref{eq:flow} and \ref{eq:transpiration} can be rearranged to calculate E:

\begin{equation}
    E = \frac{\mu_0(w_a - w_0)}{s(1 - w_a)}
\end{equation}

\noindent Calculating \(CO_2\) assimilation is similar, but in this case the gas is being taken up by the leaf and fixed during the Calvin cycle, so $c_a$ is going to be lower than $c_0$:

\begin{equation}
    sA = \mu_0 w_0 - \mu_a w_a
    \label{eq:assimilation}
\end{equation}

\noindent By rearranging equations \ref{eq:flow} and \ref{eq:assimilation}, we get:

\begin{equation}
    A = \frac{\mu_0 [c_0 - c_a (\frac{1 - w_0}{1 - w_a})]}{s}
\end{equation}

Other variables, \textit{e.g.} stomatal conductance (\textit{gsw}) and intercellular \(CO_2\) concentration ($C_i$), are calculated thanks to other measurements taken by LI-6800, including leaf temperature.
\smallskip

We measured \textit{A}, \textit{E}, \textit{gsw} and \textit{$C_i$} on multiple days for each batch. For example, the saplings from batch 1 (treated trees BQ1, BQ2, BQ3 and controls BC1 and BC2) were measured on 30th June and on 4th, 10th and 13th July. For each tree, three leaves (replicates) were selected to be measured, and each measurement was repeated three times. As an example, Table \ref{table:controls} shows the measurements that were taken on 4th July for the control trees. An average of the three values was then calculated and used for our analysis.

\subsubsection{Water potential}
%what is water potential, etc from textbook
% pressure chamber is explained in Rascio, as well 
The pressure chamber (Figure \ref{fig:pressure}) is a device for measuring water potential by applying pressure to a leaf thanks to a nitrogen tank. For our experiment, two leaves were taken from each tree and inserted in the chamber one at a time, with the cut end of the stem exposed outside of it. 
Pressure was then applied until water appeared at the surface of the exposed end. This is the amount of pressure that is equal and opposite to the water potential measurement. Therefore, higher values of pressure indicate higher stress for the tree. Maximum instrument operating pressure was 100 Bar \citep{PMS_Instrument_Company_2009}.

Measurements were taken in the early afternoon to make sure they were comparable, as water potential changes during the day, usually having the most negative values at midday. For each tree, two leaves were chosen to be measured and then an average was calculated and used for further analysis.

\subsubsection{Isotope pulse-labeling}
 For our experiment, the labeled ${}^{13} CO_2$ was pumped into plastic bags that had been wrapped around the birches' canopy. Labeled carbon  was then traced with Picarro's G2201-i Isotopic Analyzer, as it was transported from the source (leaves) to the sink organs, via the phloem. Chambers were sealed at two different locations along the stem and connected to the analyzer, so that the carbon could be traced when it respired. The difference in time lags between the appearance of labeled C at the first and second location can be used to establish phloem sap velocity \citep{Epron_D._et_al._2019}. However, this data is still being processed by Xin Zhuang, as it requires complex analysis, therefore it will not be discussed any further in this thesis.

\section{Statistical analysis}
For the statistical analysis, I used the programming language R.
\smallskip

The first part of the analysis tested whether there was a significant difference between the photosynthetic activity of cooled trees and control trees by analysing four variables: \textit{A}, \textit{E}, \textit{gsw} and \textit{$A/C_i$}. % is this correct English/ understandable?
The possibility of a significant difference among the four batches had to be taken into consideration as well, as they were measured during different parts of the growing season, starting from early June and ending in mid August. % is this right? 
\smallskip

Employing a parametric ANOVA was not possible, as the distribution of the data was not normal. Therefore, this data was tested for difference in significance ($P<0.05$) using the Scheirer–Ray–Hare test, which is a non-parametric test used for a two-way factorial design (Sokal and Rohlf, 1995).  
\smallskip

An example of the code used for the this part, for the variable \textit{A}, is given below:

\begin{verbatim}
    SRH_A <- scheirerRayHare(avg.A_2 ~ batch + treatment, 
             data=licor_avg_2)
\end{verbatim}

The second part of the analysis investigated the effect of soil cooling on those same 4 gas exchange variables, looking for a correlation between gas exchange variables and temperature values. The significance was once again set at $P<0.05$. % this sentence needs rephrasing
Because the distribution was not normal, linear regression was not suitable, so the gamma distribution model was used for \textit{A} and \textit{$A/C_i$}, whereas the General Additive Model (GAM) was employed for \textit{E} and \textit{gsw}. %short description of GAM?

Examples of the code are given below for \textit{A}:

\begin{verbatim}
    gammaA <- glm(formula = licor_avg_2$avg.A_2 ~ licor_avg_2$batch +
    licor_avg_2$soil_temperature, family = Gamma(), data = licor_avg_2)
\end{verbatim}

And for \textit{E}:

\begin{verbatim}
    gammaE <- glm(formula = licor_avg_2$avg.E_2 ~ licor_avg_2$batch + 
    licor_avg_2$soil_temperature, family = Gamma(), data = licor_avg_2)
\end{verbatim}
    
The models were validated with the help of diagnostic plots (Zuur, 2009), as shown in Figure \ref{fig:diagnostics}, for \textit{A}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering 
\graphicspath{ {./images/} }
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/diagnostic_plot_A.png}
    \caption{\textit{Diagnostic plots for the gamma distribution model (A  soil temperature). The four plots show response residuals (observed minus fitted values), Pearson residuals, scaled Pearson residuals and deviance residuals.}}
    \label{fig:diagnostics}
\end{figure}

The data is not normal, so the plots are supposed to show a lack of pattern (Zuur, 2009). % i don't know whether to put the diagnostic plots here, because I don't understand the statistics very well (only the basics) e. g. the different residuals
\smallskip

The same models and validation were used to examine the effect of water potential on the 4 gas exchange variables, with the following code (for \textit{A}):

\begin{verbatim}
    gammaA2 <- glm(licor_avg_3$avg.A_2 ~ licor_avg_3$batch 
    + licor_avg_3$water_potential, data=licor_avg_3, family=Gamma())
\end{verbatim}

\section{Results}
This section will discuss results pertaining to batch 1, 2 and 4, whereas batch 3 will not be included due to anomalies found throughout the data analysis. 
\smallskip

The first part of the analysis aimed at comparing the photosynthetic activity in control trees and treated trees. The four gas exchange variables all showed a significant difference, with 3 of them (\textit{A}, \textit{E} and \textit{gsw}) having a p-value of 0.00000. % rephrasing
The boxplots (Figure \ref{fig:A}, Figure \ref{fig:E} and Figure \ref{fig:gsw}) show that the control trees had significantly higher values than the treated trees. The difference between values of the two groups is represented with a boxplot. The box includes the values between the first and the third quartile and is divided by a line, the median. The "whiskers" show the values outside of the central 50\%. 
For instance, the median of \textit{A} values for the controls was about 9 $\mu mol m^{-2} s^{-1}$, whereas the median for the cooled trees was less than 5 $\mu mol m^{-2}s^{-1}$. 

\begin{figure}[H]

\graphicspath{ {./images/} }
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/A.png}
    \caption{\textit{$CO_2$ assimilation rate in cooled and control trees. }}
    \label{fig:A}
\end{figure}

The median of \textit{E} values for the controls is about $2x10^{-3}$ $mol m^{-2}s^{-1}$, while the median for the treated trees is about $5x10^-4$ $molm^{-2}s^{-1}$. 

\begin{figure}[H]

\graphicspath{ {./images/} }
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/E.png}
    \caption{\textit{Evapotranspiration rate in cooled and control trees.}}
    \label{fig:E}
\end{figure}

The median of \textit{gsw} values for the controls was about 0.14 $mol m^{-2}s^{-1}$, whereas the median for the cooled trees was less than 0.05 $mol m^{-2}s^{-1}$. 

\begin{figure}[H]

    \caption{\textit{Stomatal conductance to water vapor in cooled and control trees.}}
    \label{fig:gsw}
\end{figure}

Photosynthetic efficiency was also significantly different in control trees and treated trees, however the p-value was higher (0.00689). This can be seen in boxplot \ref{fig:A-Ci}: control trees have higher values than treated trees, but the medians of the two groups are closer to one another (0.03 for the controls and about 0.2 for the treated trees). 

\begin{figure}[H]

    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{images/A-Ci.png}
    \caption{\textit{Photosynthetic efficiency in cooled and control trees.}}
    \label{fig:A-Ci}
\end{figure}

The fourth variable $A/C_i$ is defined as photosynthetic efficiency, or the amount of carbon that is assimilated by the leaf normalized by the \(CO_2\) concentration inside the leaf.

Scatter plots were created to statistically examine
