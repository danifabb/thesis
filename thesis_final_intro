\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

\subsection{Photosynthesis}

Photosynthesis is the basis of the ecosystem food chain and “the ultimate source of all of humankind’s food and oxygen” (Johnson, 2016). Oxygenic photosynthesis is a process that allows certain organisms, including plants, to harvest solar energy to synthesize organic carbon compounds, starting from carbon dioxide and water and generating oxygen as well (Arnon, 1971): 

\begin{equation}
   6H_2O + 6CO_2 + light \rightarrow C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2
    \label{eq:photosynthesis}
\end{equation}

The photosynthetic processes described here concern C3 plants, and not C4 and CAM plants, which mostly live in tropical climates and have a different anatomy and different photosynthetic strategies.
\smallskip

Photosynthesis mostly takes place in the leaves. Figure \ref{fig:leaf} shows the typical anatomy of a leaf. Different cell types in the leaf contribute to the photosynthetic process: 
$CO_2$ entry is controlled by stomata in the lower epidermis, photosynthetic parenchyma (mesophyll) cells contain many chloroplasts and are the principal center of photosynthesis, whereas vascular tissues transport the sap with the necessary compounds into the leaves (xylem), or towards the rest of the plant (phloem) (Mauseth J., 2006). 
\smallskip

Figure from Diah et al., 2014.}
    \label{fig:leaf}
\end{figure}

The site of photosynthesis in the cell is the chloroplast, an organelle with two outer membranes and one thylakoid membrane. The thylakoid membrane divides the chloroplast into two spaces: the stroma on the outside and the lumen on the inside. 
\smallskip

In plants, photosynthesis can be divided into two phases: 

\begin{itemize}

\item A first light-dependent phase that happens in the thylakoid membrane. It results in the production of adenosine triphosphate  (ATP) and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). The energy of light is thus converted into chemical energy.

\item A second metabolic phase that happens in the stroma. Here, ATP (high-energy compound) and NADPH (high reducing power) are used by the enzymes of the Calvin-Benson cycle and $CO_2$ gets reduced and fixed into carbohydrates (Johnson, 2016). ATP and NADPH provide the 479 kJ that are necessary for photosynthesis to occur, as it is an endergonic process (Antal et al., 2013). 

\end{itemize}

Thylakoid membranes are the site of the electron transport chain (light phase of photosynthesis). Figure from Taiz \& Zeiger, 2002}.
    \label{fig:chlor}
\end{figure}

The first phase of photosynthesis requires pigments, which in plant cells are mainly chlorophyll \textit{a} and \textit{b}, \textit{i.e.} molecules with a ring structure similar to porphyrin (Quieroz et al., 2017). When chlorophyll absorbs photons at certain wavelengths - mostly the blue (425–450 nm) and red parts (600–700 nm) of the visible spectrum -, it reaches an excited, unstable state {that cannot be maintained for long}. As the excited molecule goes back to its ground state, the extra energy can be disposed of through energy transfer to a neighboring molecule, which in turn becomes excited (Rascio et al. 2017). This is the process that happens in photosystems I and II, two complexes that can be found in the thylakoid membrane. They are formed by hundreds of pigment molecules that collect and transfer energy to a reaction center, called P680 in photosystem I and P700 in Photosystem II. Two chlorophylls in the reaction center behave differently than other pigments in the complex: instead of transferring energy, one of them undergoes oxidation, transferring an electron to the other and thus making a redox chain possible (Johnson, 2016). 
\smallskip

The electron transport chain (Figure \ref{fig:light}) involves a series of molecules that are present in the thylakoid membrane, ending with ferredoxin/ NADP+ reductase (FNR). This pathway is unidirectional, as electrons are transferred from stronger reductants to weaker ones (Arnon, 1971). As a result of the electron chain, NAPD+ is reduced to NADPH, whereas water reduces oxidized P680 back to its former state and is therefore converted to oxygen. The electron chain also causes proton transport across the membrane, with an accumulation of protons in the lumen. This gradient is used by the ATP synthase to generate ATP through phosphorylation. (Hill and Bendall, 1960 + Johnson, 2016).

    \label{fig:light}
\end{figure}

After the light-dependent reactions, there is a metabolic phase: $CO_2$ is fixed into organic compounds during the Calvin-Benson cycle, which is made up of 13 reactions. Primary $CO_2$ assimilation is catalyzed by the enzyme RuBisCO (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/ oxygenase), when the sugar ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate undergoes carboxylation. The first three reactions lead to the formation of two molecules of a triose phosphate called glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), thanks to the previously produced ATP and NADPH, which provide energy and reducing power. The other ten reactions aim at regenerating RuBP so that it can be used in the next cycle (Biel \& Fomina, 2015). In total, the cycle uses 3 molecules of ATP and 2 of NADPH to assimilate one $CO_2$ molecule (Rascio, 2017). 
\smallskip

When three $CO_2$ are fixed into six G3P molecules, five of these molecules become a part of the cycle again, by being regenerated into RuBP; the sixth molecule is converted into other compounds, such as sucrose and starch (Johnson, 2016).

\subsection{Water potential and xylem transport}
Sap (water and minerals) is absorbed by the roots and then travels inside a vascular tissue, the xylem, throughout the root system, the stem and the leaves. In Angiosperms, the xylem is constituted by dead, elongated cells that belong to two different categories, tracheids and vessel elements. Both have lignified secondary walls and are stacked on top of one another, but vessel elements have perforated cross walls, forming a continuous tube (Venturas et al., 2017). 
\smallskip

% xylem image?
The concept of water potential, which is defined as a "measure of the free energy of water per unit volume (J $m^{-3}$)" relative to pure water in reference conditions (Taiz \& Zeiger, 2002), is fundamental to explain sap transport inside the plant. Water potential can be described by equation \ref{eq:water}:

\begin{equation}
 \psi_{H_{2}O} = \mu_{H_2O}/V_{H_2O},  
 \label{eq:water}
\end{equation}

where $\mu$ is the chemical potential of water and $V_{H_2O}$ is its molar volume (Rascio, 2017). It is made up of different components, which can be summarized by equation \ref{eq:potential}:

\begin{equation}
    \psi_{H_2O} = \psi_s + \psi_p + \psi_g
    \label{eq:potential}
\end{equation}

$\psi_g$ is the gravity component, which has a minor role in small plants. $\psi_p$ is the hydrostatic pressure: when it increases, this factor causes $\psi_{H_2O}$ to get higher. Osmotic potential ($\psi_s$) describes the effect of solutes on $\psi_{H_2O}$. It becomes more negative as solutes accumulate in a plant cell, causing the water potential to also decrease. Water moves from higher to lower values  when a $\Delta\psi_{H_2O}$ is present (Taiz \& Zeiger, 2002). 
\smallskip

The roots can contribute directly to water uptake by generating a $\Delta\psi_{H_2O}$ between soil and root, which is caused by an osmotic gradient. As ions accumulate in the xylem, $\psi_s$ increases, and $\psi_{H_2O}$ decreases, allowing water to flow in (Gambetta et al., 2017). 

The main force that drives sap transport, however, is a pressure gradient (($\Delta\psi_p$) between leaves and roots, as the cohesion-tension theory claims. According to this theory, water in the xylem behaves like a cohesive, unbroken column that can ascend from roots to leaves because it is driven by evapotranspiration happening inside pores of leaf cell walls. Because of the hydrophilic elements in the cell wall, as the water evaporates, the meniscus becomes more concave. The concavity of the water-air interfaces inside the mesophyll cell walls creates a negative pressure (water potential), which propagates to neighboring areas, creating the driving force necessary to pull water from the soil to the evaporation site (Brown, 2013). Unless a plant is stressed due to excessive transpiration, the transpired water should be entirely replaced by the water absorbed by the roots and then transported inside the xylem (Hölttä et al., 2017).

The rate of root water uptake (Q) depends on the water potential gradient between the soil and the xylem, and on root surface area (S) (Gambetta, 2017). Hydraulic conductivity (Lp) summarizes the relationship with the following equation:

\begin{equation}
    Lp= Q/\Delta\psi*S
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[H]

    \label{fig:conductance}
\end{figure}

% bigger water pot gradients --> higher traspiration rate --> higher stress due to water loss 

\subsection{Stomata} \label{sec: stomata}
While the relative water vapor concentration in the mesophyll is greater than its concentration in the atmosphere, due to xylem activity, the opposite is true for $CO_2$ concentration, which is lower in the leaf (Venturas et al., 2017). These concentration gradients control water loss ($H_2O$ evapotranspiration) and $CO_2$ uptake, which are also influenced by another factor, the diffusional resistance. Thus, the transpiration rate can be calculated with the following equation:

\begin{equation}
    Tr = \frac{C_{w leaf} - C_{w air}}{R_{leaf} + R_{air}}
\end{equation}

$C_{w leaf}$ and $C_{w air}$ are the concentrations of water vapor in the leaf and in the air, while $R_{leaf}$ and $R_{air}$  represent the resistance in those same spaces (Rascio et al., 2017). 
\smallskip

In particular, $R_{leaf}$ is the leaf stomatal resistance to gas diffusion, \textit{i.e.} the resistance associated with the stomatal pores in the epidermis of leaves. Plants transpire and take up $CO_2$ through these apertures, therefore the regulation of their size is essential to make sure the plant does not lose too much water, but still gets enough $CO_2$. Thus, stomatal resistance is controlled by two guard cells that surround the pore and can sense temperature, humidity, intracellular $CO_2$ concentration and other factors. They respond by changing their turgor pressure, which leads to the opening or closing of the pores (Taiz \& Zeiger, 2002). % co2-evapotransp trade-off

    \caption{Water and $CO_2$ uptake thorugh the leaf. The concentration gradients control water loss and $CO_2$ uptake through stomatal apertures e.g. vapor content concentration in the leaf is higher than in the atmosphere. Stomata exert physical resistance to the gas diffusion.}
    \label{fig:leaf_2}
\end{figure}

Stomatal resistance is influenced by temperature. For instance, at mid to high latitudes, an increase in temperature is associated with a higher $\Delta C_w$ between the leaf and the air, and therefore to higher transpiration rates, causing an increase in stomatal resistance (Rascio et al., 2017). The rate of photosynthesis and stomatal conductance are also interconnected: with high photosynthetic activity, stomatal conductance (the inverse of stomatal resistance) is also high, but an increase in the internal leaf $CO_2$ concentration can cause an increase in stomatal resistance in order to limit water loss (Jarvis \& Davis, 1997).

\subsection{The phloem}
\subsubsection{Structure and function}
The phloem is a tissue that allows long-distance transport (translocation) of photosynthates, \textit{i.e.} the product of photosynthesis. Redistribution of water and other compounds is another one of its functions. Photosynthates must be transported from their source, typically mature leaves, to areas of growth that are unable to produce enough assimilates, such as young leaves, fruits, or roots. Storage organs, including roots, tubers and rhizomes, can be both sink, when accumulating nutrients, and source, when providing said nutrients to the plant body during winter or other stress-inducing times (Taiz \& Zeiger, 2002). Seeds do the same, transitioning from sink to source when they germinate, so that the resources that they accumulated as starch can be used by the new plant to grow (Rascio et al., 2017).
\smallskip

In Angiosperms, which are the main object of research on the phloem, xylem and phloem form vascular tissues that extend throughout the plant body, with the xylem being usually closer to the centre of the stem (or the root), and the phloem on the outer side (Taiz \& Zeiger, 2002). The two continuously exchange water. 
\smallskip

The phloem is made up of living cells belonging to three different categories: sieve elements, companion cells and parenchymatic cells. In Angiosperms, sieve elements are roughly cylinder-shaped cells that are stacked on top of each other, forming a sieve tube (Rascio et al., 2017). Cross walls separating the cells are perforated by pores (Figure \ref{fig:sieve}), forming sieve plates, to achieve symplastic continuity and a higher hydraulic conductance inside the tube (Peters \& Knoblauch, 2022). As sieve cells do not possess a nucleus, a cytoskeleton and other essential organelles, each sieve cell is associated with one or more companion cells. Plasmodesmata provide a close symplastic relationship between sieve cells and companion cells. The latter have intense metabolic activity and are responsible for the survival of the sieve cells. They also contribute to the transport of photosynthates from mesophyll cells in leaves, where they are produced, to sieve cells (Rascio et al., 2017).

    \label{fig:sieve}
\end{figure}

Phloem sap is rich in sucrose, varying from 0.3 to 0.9 M in concentration. In addition to sucrose, the phloem of certain plant families also contains high concentrations of sugar alcohols like mannitol and carbohydrates like raffinose and stachyose. Other solutes in lower concentrations include amino acids, hormones, proteins and inorganic solutes (Taiz \& Zeiger, 2002). 
\smallskip

Long-distance transport in the phloem is usually explained by the pressure-flow hypothesis, formulated by Ernst Münch in the 1920s. The hypothesis states that mass flow of water and solutes in the phloem is driven by an osmotically induced pressure gradient between source and sink organs (Figure \ref{fig:munch}). The loading of photosynthates into the sieve elements at the source causes a low osmotic potential ($\Psi_s$), which in turn causes a negative water potential ($\Psi_w$), so that water is drawn into the phloem from neighboring xylem tissue and thus increase the turgor pressure near the source. The opposite phenomenon happens in the sink organs, where photoassimilates are unloaded from the sieve elements and water potential becomes more positive, leading water to leave the phloem as well and the turgor pressure to decrease. This difference in turgor pressure ($\Delta P$), which is higher at the source and lower at the sink, pushes the fluid along the phloem from source to sink (Knoblauch et al, 2016).

    \caption{\textit{Relationship between xylem and phloem.

    \label{fig:munch}
\end{figure}

Because the phloem sap is rich in nutrients, it is very likely to be attacked by predators or parasites. Therefore, the tissue employs some strong defense mechanisms. For instance, plants use callose to occlude wounded sieve tubes and protect them from attacks (Will et al., 2013). It can be difficult to do experiments on the phloem, as the sensors that are inserted in the tree to measure phloem transport get sealed off due to the same defense mechanisms. The phloem has been called “the least understood plant tissue” due to such difficulties (Knoblauch et al, 2016). Indirect methods, such as isotope labeling, can be used instead. % labeling
% 1 species Ricinus does not do that. Slightly toxic. For most plants you need indirect methods (labeling or measuring what comes out - proxy). Few methods that are expensive. Also, it is soft, difficult to take samples. 

\subsubsection{Source-sink interrelationship} \label{sec:source}
Apart from translocation, an area of interest when studying the phloem is the source-sink interrelationship. This topic is particularly useful for a deeper understanding of carbon allocation, \textit{i.e} the regulation of the distribution of carbon among different pathways (accumulation, transport, metabolism). Starch functions as an energy reserve and is the main molecule used for accumulation, as opposed to as sucrose, which is mostly used for transport (Taiz \& Zeiger, 2002). Plants are able to adjust their starch and sucrose production according to different conditions. For example, if all but one soybean leaves are shaded for several days, the only source leaf experiences an increase in the rate of net photosynthesis, a decrease in starch concentration and an increase in sucrose concentration (Thorne \& Koller, 1974).
\smallskip

Carbon allocation is influenced by the communication between source and sink, namely a decreased sink demand can lead to a decrease in the speed of phloem transport and to limitations in source organ activity (Taiz \& Zeiger, 2002). This acclimation to changing source-sink relationships ensures a better coordination among source photosynthetic activity, phloem translocation and sink organ demand. 
\smallskip

Decreased sink demand can happen, for example, if a plant undergoes defruiting, because sink size (the total biomass of sink tissue) gets reduced. Temperature can also have an effect on sink demand by influencing sink activity (the rate of uptake of photoassimilates): if root temperature goes down, the process of respiration - which consumes the sugars produced by photosynthesis and is the main driver for root growth - decreases as well. Thus, less carbon is required for respiration and its allocation towards the roots is limited by lower temperatures (Lambers, 2008). 
Together, sink size and sink activity co-regulate sink strength, the ability of the sink organ to import photoassimilates (Balasubramanian et al., 2023).
\smallskip 

Communication between source and sink can happen through various means, including transport sugars themselves. According to this model, decreased sink demand causes high sucrose levels in the phloem, which in turn cause down-regulation of phloem loading at the source. Thus, carbohydrates accumulate in the source (mesophyll cells), which can lead to downregulation of photosynthesis (Chiou \& Bush, 1998). Generally speaking, low sugar levels cause higher photosynthetic activity, reserve mobilization and transport towards sink organs, whereas high sugar concentration encourages growth and storage, as summarized by Figure (\ref{fig:sugar}) (Rolland et al., 2002).   


\begin{figure}[H]

\graphicspath{ {./images/} }
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{images/Source-sink.png}
    \caption{Effects of sugar on source-sink activity. Image taken from Rolland et al., 2002.}
    \label{fig:sugar}
\end{figure}


% Source-sink relationship can be explored by applying a variety of treatments, such as girdling and defruiting, to plants, and can have applications in agriculture as well, if fruits are the sink organs being studied (probably cut this).
Several studies have been performed over the years about the relationship between sink demand and photosynthetic activity. For example, in Frank et. al, 2006, the authors girdled \textit{Coffea arabica} branches at their base. Girdling is a technique where scientists remove a ring of phloem is in order to disconnect source and sink in the plant. They subsequently measured total soluble sugar concentration ($SSC_m$) and maximal leaf net $CO_2$ assimilation rate $A_{max}$ on the mature leaves of the girdled branches. The results showed that $A_{max}$ was negatively correlated to $SSC_m$, that it was higher in branches with higher fruit loads and that it decreased during the day. A conclusion was drawn that there was sink feedback down-regulating photosynthesis \textit{e.g.} low fruit loads demanded less photosynthates, therefore photosynthetic activity decreased. It was thought that the feedback is mediated by the accumulation of sugars in the leaf phloem, which inhibits phloem loading. 
\smallskip

Other similar experiments on apples trees (Wünsche et al., 2005) and peach trees (Duan \& al., 2007) provided similar results, with photosynthetic rate decreasing when the crop load was reduced or removed. Da Matta et al., 2007 proposed a different conclusion regarding their experiment on coffee: the decreased \textit{A} in the leaves of the defruited trees was thought to have been caused caused not by direct sink feedback, but by the lower stomatal conductance, as (\textit{A}) and (\textit{g}) were correlated. The reason for the lower \textit{g} remains unknown.

\subsection{Soil cooling}
Other than fruits, roots can also be studied as sink organs down-regulating photosynthesis, as this thesis will investigate. As stated in section \ref{sec:source}, cooling down the roots of a tree inhibits its sink activity. This technique is not as disruptive as girdling is: since no tissues are damaged, wound responses do not get triggered, and there is a lower risk of changes in secondary metabolism affecting the experiment. 
\smallskip

Soil cooling has been known to limit photosynthesis in several different species like \textit{Artemisia tridentata} (BassiriRad et al., 1993), pine (Day et al., 1991; Lintunen et al., 2020), aspen and spruce (Cai et al., 2001. The inhibition is thought to be caused by both stomatal and non-stomatal limitation. The latter includes mesophyll and chloroplast resistance to $CO_2$ and metabolic restrictions such as RuBiSCo inactivation (Signarbieux et al, 2010; Salmon et al., 2020). 
\smallskip

Day et al., 1991 observed that stomatal limitation may have had a major role in the decrease of net photosynthetic rate as temperature dropped from 24°C to 7°C. This is suggested by stomatal resistance and intercellular $CO_2$ concentration declining as well. At temperatures below 7°C, intercellular $CO_2$ concentration increased, but the photosynthetic rate kept decreasing, suggesting non-stomatal limitation. % does this make sense? 
\smallskip

Root cooling for \textit{Artemisia tridentata} also resulted in a limitation of photosynthesis. The A (photosynthetic rate) versus $C_i$ (intercellular $CO_2$ concentration) curve did not change with temperature, which suggests stomatal limitation (BassiriRad et al., 1993). 
\smallskip

There can be multiple causes for stomatal and non-stomatal limitation. While they might be a result of direct sink feedback and sugar accumulation, they might also be connected to a lower hydraulic conductivity. When soil temperature goes down, hydraulic conductivity has been shown to also decline. Because the roots take up water less efficiently, the water potential of the entire plant is negatively affected, and stomatal conductance ends up declining as well (Day et al., 1991; Lintunen et al., 2020). % coordination between st and non-st conductance?

\subsection{\textit{Betula pendula}}
\textit{Betula pendula}, or European white birch, is a deciduous tree with white bark, drooping outer branches and an average height of 25 m (Vakkari P., 2009). Leaves are simple, triangular-shaped, with a dentate margin. It is a Eurosiberian tree distributed in almost all of Europe (but most abundant in Northern Europe) and many parts of Asia and North America (ref gbif website). Information on \textit{Betula pendula}'s vascular tissues (Figure \ref{fig:stem}), and on sink limitation is scarce, as studies are usually conducted on model organisms like \textit{Arabidopsis thaliana}.

\section{Aim of the thesis} \label{sec:aim}
The present work was conducted in the framework of Xin Zhuang’s Doctorate research. The wider scope of the experiment was a study on the effects of sink limitation on \textit{Betula pendula} source activity and carbon translocation in the phloem (Zhuang et al., in progress). This thesis focuses on part of the results, namely the effects of sink limitation on canopy photosynthesis, the hypothesis being that decreased sink activity limits source photosynthetic activity.
\smallskip
% be clear about my results vs whole experiment
Sink activity reduction was achieved by cooling the soil around the roots of 12 saplings, while 8 other trees were left untreated to function as controls. Gas exchange variables, such as $CO_2$ net assimilation rate and photosynthetic efficiency, were measured with the purpose of researching how the sink limitation created by soil cooling affected leaf photosynthetic activity. 
\smallskip

I am also reporting on the results of the water status monitoring (water potential monitoring) during the experiment. Here, soil cooling is expected to cause stress for the saplings, with less root water uptake and a decrease in water potential and stomatal conductance. The stress and the lower water uptake could also contribute to a lower stomatal conductance and lower photosynthesis, which might not be exclusively a result of direct feedback from the sink (decreased sink demand). %preliminary results

\section{Materials and Methods} \label{sec:materials}
Firstly, section \ref{sec:setup} discusses how the experiment was set up and the conditions under which it was performed (subsection 2.1). 

Then, section \ref{sec:measure} talks about the variables that were measured in order to study the effects of sink limitation on photosynthesis and hydraulic status of the saplings. 

Subsection \ref{sec:stat} is a description of the statistical analysis that was conducted to achieve the results.

%ref the 3 subsections
\subsection{Experiment setup} \label{sec:setup}
I witnessed and worked on the experiment during my time as a trainee at the University of Helsinki, under the mentorship of Xin Zhuang and the supervision of Dr Yann Salmon.
\smallskip

The experiment took place at the Viikki Campus (Department of Forest Sciences, Faculty of Agriculture and Forestry), at the University of Helsinki, in a greenhouse environment, starting from 20th June 2023 and ending on 21st August of the same year. The environmental conditions in the greenhouse were 21° C and 60\% relative humidity on average. The setup involved 20 birch saplings (\textit{Betula pendula}), of approximately 3-5 years of age and 2-2.5 m tall. The trees were replanted in 20-liter pots with a mixture of forest peat and original nursery field soil, and placed in the greenhouse a week before the start of the measurements. 
\smallskip

The LAUDA thermostat (Figure \ref{fig:lauda}) was used to bring temperature down to 4 °C, with the aim of studying the effects of the cooled-down soil on photosyntetic activity and carbon translocation. The thermostat consists of a refrigeration unit and a tubing system, which was filled with anti-freeze \citep{Lauda_Dr._R._Wobser_GMBH_and_CO._KG_1989}. The silicone tubes were buried in the pots so that they were closer to the roots, cooling them more efficiently. Further insulation was achieved by putting the pots into coolbags and wrapping foam around the tubes (Figure \ref{fig:treated}).

\subsection{Measurements} \label{sec:measure}
Measurements were taken on five trees at a time. Every group consisted of two untreated trees (controls) and three trees that had been cooled down (treatment). The first group was measured from June 30th to July 13th; the second group was measured from July 13th to August 1st; the third group was measured from August 1st to August 7th; the fourth group was measured from August 7th to August 10th. 
\smallskip

The difference in canopy source activity and tree water status between control saplings and treated saplings was estimated through several variables. For leaf photosynthetic activity, four leaf gas exchange variables were measured: $CO_2$ net assimilation rate (\textit{A}), photosynthetic efficiency (\textit{$A/C_i$}), $H_2O$ evapotranspiration rate (\textit{E}) and stomatal conductance to water vapor (\textit{gsw}). $CO_2$ net assimilation is defined as a measure of the difference between photosynthesis and respiration, while evapotranspiration measures the rate of water loss (ref licor manual). Both variables are connected to stomatal conductance, as $CO_2$ and $H_2O$ diffuse through the stomata. Photosynthetic efficiency, which is a normalization of \textit{A} by $C_i$ (intercellular $CO_2$), was calculated and used as a variable, in order to remove the effect of stomatal conductance and to have some data about non-stomatal limitation as well. % probably unclear
The four variables provide different information about photosynthesic activity, with \textit{A} and \textit{$A/C_i$} measuring the rate of photosynthesis directly, and \textit{E} and \textit{gsw} offering more general information about the degree of opening of the stomata. 
For tree hydraulic status, we monitored the water potential. The instruments used during the experiment were the LI-6800 (LI-COR’s fourth generation portable photosynthesis system), a pressure chamber for water potential, and ...
%(instrument for soil temperature, name?) 
The experiment also aimed at studying the effect of soil cooling on carbon translocation and not just photosynthetic activity, which is why we used ${}^{13} C$ pulse-labeling to the canopy with the purpose of determining changes in phloem transport velocity between the control trees and the cooled trees. 
\smallskip

\subsubsection{Gas exchange}
After burying the tubes in the pots and turning the cooling system on, we waited several hours for the soil to cool down and then at least 3 days for plants to reach a steady state, and started measuring gas exchange with the LI-6800. This instrument (Figure \ref{fig:licor}) can measure photosynthetic processes happening at leaf-level non-invasively. Several leaf chambers of different dimensions are available; for this experiment, a \(6-cm^2\)-area chamber was used.

\begin{figure}[H]

\graphicspath{ {./images/} }
    \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth, angle=270]{images/licor_1.jpg}
    \caption{\textit{Portable Photosynthesis System closed onto birch leaf.}}
    \label{fig:licor}
\end{figure}

After the chamber is closed onto a leaf, two variables, $CO_2$  net assimilation rate (\textit{A}) and $H_2O$ evapo-transpiration rate (\textit{E}), can be measured with infrared gas analysers. This is based on the difference in $CO_2$ and $H_2O$ concentration between the air in the leaf chamber, which is affected by the leaf, and air that is not (reference). Before measuring, a reference needs to be set for $CO_2$  concentration, humidity, temperature and light going into the chamber: for our experiment, a $CO_2$  concentration of 400 $\mu$mol $mol^{-1}$  and 60\% relative humidity were chosen. The temperature was set at 26° C and the light was set at 500 $\mu$mol $m^{-1}s^{-1}$. 
\smallskip 

 LI-6800 measures the flow rate ($\mu$mol air $s^{-1}$) and the $CO_2$ and $H_2O$  concentrations (\textit{$\mu_0$}, \textit{$c_0$}, \textit{$w_0$} respectively) before entering the leaf chamber(Figure \ref{fig:chamber}). $CO_2$ and water vapor concentrations (\textit{$c_a$} and \textit{$w_a$} respectively) are then measured again after coming out of the chamber. 
\smallskip


\begin{figure}[H]

    \caption{\textit{Schematic of LI-6800 gas exchange system. Reference from (licor manual)}}
    \label{fig:chamber}
\end{figure}

\noindent While the flow rate exiting the chamber ($\mu_a$) is not directly measured, it is assumed that the water vapor released by the leaf will be added to the $\mu_0$: 
\begin{equation}
    \mu_a = \mu_0 + sE
    \label{eq:flow}
\end{equation}
where \textit{s} represents leaf area.
\smallskip

\noindent Transpiration on a leaf area basis can be calculated as: 
\begin{equation}
    sE = \mu_a w_a - \mu_0 w_0
    \label{eq:transpiration}
\end{equation}

\noindent Equation \ref{eq:flow} and \ref{eq:transpiration} can be rearranged to calculate E:

\begin{equation}
    E = \frac{\mu_0(w_a - w_0)}{s(1 - w_a)}
\end{equation}

\noindent Calculating the $CO_2$ net assimilation rate is similar, but in this case the gas is being taken up by the leaf and fixed during the Calvin cycle, so $c_a$ is going to be lower than $c_0$:

\begin{equation}
    sA = \mu_0 w_0 - \mu_a w_a
    \label{eq:assimilation}
\end{equation}

\noindent By rearranging equations \ref{eq:flow} and \ref{eq:assimilation}, we get:

\begin{equation}
    A = \frac{\mu_0 [c_0 - c_a (\frac{1 - w_0}{1 - w_a})]}{s}
\end{equation}

Other variables, \textit{e.g.} stomatal conductance to water vapor (\textit{gsw}) and intercellular \(CO_2\) concentration ($C_i$), are calculated thanks to other measurements taken by LI-6800, including leaf temperature.
\smallskip

We measured \textit{A}, \textit{E}, \textit{gsw} and \textit{$C_i$} on multiple days for each batch. For example, the saplings from batch 1 (treated trees BQ1, BQ2, BQ3 and controls BC1 and BC2) were measured on 30th June and on 4th, 10th and 13th July. For each tree, three leaves (replicates) were selected to be measured, and each measurement was repeated three times. As an example, Table \ref{table:controls} shows the measurements that were taken on 4th July for the control trees. An average of the three values was then calculated and used for our analysis.

\subsubsection{Water potential}
%what is water potential, etc from textbook
% pressure chamber is explained in Rascio, as well 
The pressure chamber (Figure \ref{fig:pressure}) is a device for measuring water potential by applying pressure to a leaf thanks to a nitrogen tank. For our experiment, two leaves were taken from each tree and inserted in the chamber one at a time, with the cut end of the stem exposed outside of it. 
Pressure was then applied until water appeared at the surface of the exposed end. This is the amount of pressure that is equal and opposite to the water potential measurement. Therefore, higher values of pressure indicate higher stress for the tree. Maximum instrument operating pressure was 100 Bar \citep{PMS_Instrument_Company_2009}.

Measurements were taken in the early afternoon to make sure they were comparable, as water potential changes during the day, usually having the most negative values at midday. For each tree, two leaves were chosen to be measured and then an average was calculated and used for further analysis.

\subsubsection{Isotope pulse-labeling}
 For our experiment, the labeled ${}^{13} CO_2$ was pumped into plastic bags that had been wrapped around the birches' canopy. Labeled carbon  was then traced with Picarro's G2201-i Isotopic Analyzer, as it was transported from the source (leaves) to the sink organs, via the phloem. Chambers were sealed at two different locations along the stem and connected to the analyzer, so that the carbon could be traced when it respired. The difference in time lags between the appearance of labeled C at the first and second location can be used to establish phloem sap velocity \citep{Epron_D._et_al._2019}. However, this data is still being processed by Xin Zhuang, as it requires complex analysis, therefore it will not be discussed any further in this thesis.

\subsection{Statistical analysis} \label{sec:stat}
For the statistical analysis, I used the programming language R (R Core Team, 2023).
\smallskip
% add packages used
The first part of the analysis tested whether there was a significant difference between the leaf gas exchange of cooled trees and control trees by analysing four variables: \textit{A}, \textit{$A/C_i$}, \textit{E} and \textit{gsw}. The possibility of a significant difference among the four batches had to be taken into consideration as well, as they were measured during different parts of the growing season, starting from early June and ending in mid August.
\smallskip

Employing a parametric ANOVA was not possible, as the distribution of the data was not normal nor were the residual of the ANOVA analysis. Data transformation did not solve the issue. Therefore, these data were tested for difference using the Scheirer–Ray–Hare test with a significance level of $0.05$. The Scheirer–Ray–Hare test is a non-parametric test used for a two-way factorial design (Sokal and Rohlf, 1995).    
\smallskip

An example of the code used for the this part, for the variable \textit{A}, is given below:

\begin{verbatim}
    SRH_A <- scheirerRayHare(avg.A ~ batch + treatment, 
             data=licor_avg)
\end{verbatim}

The second part of the analysis aimed at studying whether there was a significant effect of soil cooling (and soil temperature in general) on the same four gas exchange variables. $P<0.05$ was considered to be statistically significant here as well.
Because the distribution of the data as well as of the residual of the linear regression were not normal, a classical linear regression was not suitable. Instead, a generalized linear model with a gamma distribution was used for \textit{A} and \textit{$A/C_i$}. This distribution looks like a Gaussian distribution skewed to the left (Zuur et al., 2009), which is similar to how the distribution for \textit{A} values appears (Figure \ref{fig:distrib}).

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering 
\graphicspath{ {./images/} }
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/A_distrib.png}
    \caption{\textit{$CO_2$ net assimilation in cooled and control trees. }}
    \label{fig:distrib}
\end{figure}

An example of the code is given below for \textit{A}:

\begin{verbatim}
    gammaA <- glm(formula = licor_avg_2$avg.A ~ 
              licor_avg_2$batch + licor_avg_2$soil_temperature,
              family = Gamma(), data = licor_avg)
\end{verbatim}

The response of the other two variables (\textit{E} and \textit{gsw}) to the soil temperature was also non-linear, even after data transformation was attempted. Therefore, the Generalized Additive Model (GAM) was employed instead of the Generalized Linear Model. The Generalized Additive Model is suitable to study non-linear relationships and fit the data better than the gamma distribution.

Here is an example for \textit{E}:

\begin{verbatim}
   gamE <- gam(licor_avg$avg.E ~ 
           s(licor_avg_2$soil_temperature, fx = FALSE, k=3, 
           bs = "cr") + s(licor_avg_2$batch, fx = FALSE, k=3, 
           bs = "cr"))
\end{verbatim}
    
The models were validated with the help of diagnostic plots (Zuur et al., 2009), as shown in Figure \ref{fig:diagnostics}, for \textit{A}. % choose just one of the four. If there was a variable that was important and we had not considered, then a pattern would appear. or model is just not caupturing data well.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering 
\graphicspath{ {./images/} }
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/diagnostic_plot_A.png}
    \caption{\textit{Diagnostic plots for the gamma distribution model (A  soil temperature). The four plots show response residuals (observed minus fitted values), Pearson residuals, scaled Pearson residuals and deviance residuals.}}
    \label{fig:diagnostics}
\end{figure}

The data is not normally distributed, which means that the model is a good fit for the data if the diagnostic plots show a lack of pattern (Zuur, 2009). % i don't know whether to put the diagnostic plots here, because I don't understand the statistics very well (only the basics) e. g. the different residuals
\smallskip

The same models and the same validation process were chosen for the third part of the analysis, where the effect of water potential on the four gas exchange variables was examined, with the following code (for \textit{A}):

\begin{verbatim}
    gammaA2 <- glm(licor_avg$avg.A ~ 
               licor_avg_3$batch + licor_avg_3$water_potential,
               data=licor_avg_3, family=Gamma())
\end{verbatim}

% add a callback to the Aim of the thesis

\subsection{Effect of soil temperature on leaf gas exchange}
The first part of the analysis aimed at comparing the photosynthetic activity in control trees and treated trees. The four gas exchange variables measured all showed a significant difference between the two groups. A boxplot, generated using the package \texttt{ggplot2} (Wickham, 2016), was chosen to represent this difference. The box includes the values between the first and the third quartile and is divided by a line, the median. The "whiskers" show the values outside of the central 50\%. The boxplots (Figure \ref{fig:A}, Figure \ref{fig:E} and Figure \ref{fig:gsw}) show that the control trees had significantly higher values than the treated trees (p-value$<10^{-5}$). 

The median of \textit{A} values for the controls was about 9 $\mu mol m^{-2} s^{-1}$, whereas the median for the cooled trees was less than 5 $\mu mol m^{-2}s^{-1}$ (Figure \ref{fig:A}). 

\begin{figure}[H]

\graphicspath{ {./images/} }
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/A.png}
    \caption{\textit{$CO_2$ net assimilation in control and cooled trees. The boxplot on the left (control trees) shows significantly higher values and a higher median that the boxplot on the right (treated trees).}}
    \label{fig:A}
\end{figure}

The median of \textit{E} values for the controls is about $2x10^{-3}$ $mol m^{-2}s^{-1}$, while the median for the treated trees is about $5x10^-4$ $molm^{-2}s^{-1}$ (Figure \ref{fig:E}). 

\begin{figure}[H]

\graphicspath{ {./images/} }
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/E.png}
    \caption{\textit{Evapotranspiration rate in control and cooled trees.}}
    \label{fig:E}
\end{figure}

The median of \textit{gsw} values for the controls was about 0.14 $mol m^{-2}s^{-1}$, whereas the median for the cooled trees was less than 0.05 $mol m^{-2}s^{-1}$ (Figure \ref{fig:gsw}).

    \caption{\textit{Stomatal conductance to water vapor in control and cooled trees.}}
    \label{fig:gsw}
\end{figure}

Photosynthetic efficiency was also significantly different in control trees and treated trees, however the p-value was higher (0.007). Boxplot \ref{fig:A-Ci} shows that control trees have higher values than treated trees, but the medians of the two groups are closer to one another (0.03 $mol m^{-2} s{-1}$ for the controls and about 0.02 $mol m^{-2} s{-1}$ for the treated trees).

    \caption{\textit{Photosynthetic efficiency in control and cooled trees.}}
    \label{fig:A-Ci}
\end{figure}

Having established that the cooled trees have significantly lower values for the gas exchange variables, the second part of the analysis adds to the first part by focusing on the impact of low soil temperatures (explanatory variable) on the leaf gas exchange variables (response variables). The impact on the four variables proved to be significant, as shown by the p-values for the slope of the model.

The relationship between \textit{A} and soil temperature had a p-value=$3x10^{-5}$ for the slope of the model. All batches show a decrease in $CO_2$ assimilation as temperature decreases (Figure \ref{fig:A2}. However, there is a significant difference among the batches, as well (p-value=0.044). In particular, batch 1 shows a steeper slope, as the \textit{A} values for control trees are higher.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering 
\graphicspath{ {./images/} }
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{images/A2.png}
    \caption{\textit{The scatter plot shows the effect of soil temperature on $CO_2$ assimilation. Batches 1, 2 and 4 are represented by different colors, whereas two different shapes are used for control (circle) and treated (triangle) trees. All batches show an increase as temperature increases.}}
    \label{fig:A2}
\end{figure}

The relationship between \textit{$A/C_i$} and soil temperature is significant, but the p-value is higher (p=0.032), as a lot of the cooled trees have high photosynthetic efficiency values (Figure \ref{fig:A_over_Ci2}). Once again, batch 1 has a steeper slope than the other two batches (p-value=0.003).

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering 
\graphicspath{ {./images/} }
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{images/A_over_Ci2.png}
    \caption{\textit{The scatter plot shows the effect of soil temperature on photosynthetic efficiency. All batches show an increase as temperature increases.}}
    \label{fig:A_over_Ci2}
\end{figure}

Soil temperature had a significant effect on \textit{E}, with a p-value$<2x10^{-16}$ (Figure \ref{fig:E2}).  

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering 
\graphicspath{ {./images/} }
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{images/E2.png}
    \caption{\textit{The scatter plot shows the effect of soil temperature on the $H_2O$ evapotraspiration rate. All batches show an increase as temperature increases.}}
    \label{fig:E2}
\end{figure}

The scatter plot representing the effect of soil temperature on \textit{gsw} shows a similar trend to the previous plot, with the same p-value. This is to be expected, given the close relation between the two variables. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering 
\graphicspath{ {./images/} }
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{images/gsw2.png}
    \caption{\textit{The scatter plot shows the effect of soil temperature on the stomatal conductance. All batches show an increase as temperature increases.}}
    \label{fig:gsw2}
\end{figure}

These last two plots show the clearest relationship between response variable and explanatory variable and the biggest difference between control trees values and cooled trees values. The reason why batch 1 has a steeper slope and higher gas exchange values might be because it was measured earlier in the growing season, when photosynthetic activity is usually higher. % source


\subsection{Effect of water potential on leaf gas exchange}
The third part of the analysis looked at the water potential data. The hypothesis that was made in the Aim of Thesis (\ref{sec:aim}) was that hydraulic conductance, and thus water potential as well, would be negatively affected by soil cooling, showing a decrease as soil temperature dropped. In order to verify this, the effect of soil temperature on water potential was examined using a gamma distribution model. In this case, the hypothesis was proven wrong: with a p-value=0.4462, the relationship was not significant.    
\smallskip

A further analysis was made to establish whether water potential affected the four gas exchange variables. Here, the explanatory variable (water potential) had a significant impact on all four response variables: gas exchange variables increased as water potential decreased, which is an unexpected result, as lower water potential values indicates a stressed plant. %source 
The relationship between \textit{A} values and water potential can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:A3_full} (p-value=0.009 for the slope of the model).

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering 
\graphicspath{ {./images/} }
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/A3_full.png}
    \caption{\textit{Relationship between \textit{A} (response variable) and water potential (explanatory variable). $CO_2$ assimilation increases as water potential decreases.}}
    \label{fig:A3_full}
\end{figure}

A second plot (Figure \ref{fig:A3}) shows that control trees and treated trees were affected differently by the change in water potential. \textit{A} values in control trees increase significantly as water potential decreases (p-value=0.002), whereas \textit{A} values in treated trees are stable.

\begin{figure}[H]

    \caption{\textit{Relationship between \textit{A} (response variable) and water potential (explanatory variable), with a distinction made between control trees (violet) and cooled trees (yellow).}}
    \label{fig:A3}
\end{figure}

Similar results can be found for \textit{E} values (Figure \ref{fig:E3} and \textit{gsw} values (Figure \ref{fig:gsw3}), which both increase significantly as water potential decreases (p-value are 0.008 and 0.004, respectively).

    \label{fig:gsw3}
\end{figure}

Finally, the plot representing the effect of water potential on photosynthetic efficiency shows a decrease of $A/C_i$ as water potential decreases, however only the slope for the control trees is significant (p-value=0.006). 

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering

    \label{fig:A_over_Ci3}
\end{figure}

The results for the third part of the analysis are difficult to explain, as they contradict the initial hypothesis. It is possible that another factor that was not taken into consideration might have had an impact on the control trees (but not on the cooled trees), causing the increase of the gas exchange values and/ or interacting with the water potential. % rewrite
