\section{Results} \label{sec:res}
This section will discuss results pertaining to batch 1, 2 and 4. Batch 3 will not be included due to anomalies found throughout the data analysis. 
\smallskip

In section \ref{sec:aim} (Aim of the thesis), two hypothesis had been put forward. The first one proposed that the soil cooling would cause a reduced sink activity, which would result in a decreased rate of photosynthesis, because of a negative feedback mechanism. This hypothesis was investigated by comparing the leaf gas exchange values of cooled trees and control trees (section \ref{sec:first}) and by studying the effect of soil temperature (explanatory variable) on the leaf gas exchange variables (response variables) (\ref{sec:second}).
\smallskip

The second hypothesis suggested that low soil temperature has an effect on water potential, which in turn can affect the photosynthetic rate, contributing to its decline. The impact of soil temperature on water potential and the effect of water potential on leaf gas exchange are discussed in section \ref{sec:third}.


\subsection{Comparison between gas exchange values in control trees and cooled trees} \label{sec:first}
The first part of the analysis aimed at comparing the photosynthetic activity in control trees and treated trees. 
%The four gas exchange variables measured all showed a significant difference between the two groups (cut) 
\textit{A}, \textit{E} and \textit{gsw} values were significantly different between the two groups. A boxplot, generated using the package \texttt{ggplot2} (Wickham, 2016), was chosen to represent this difference. The box includes the values between the first and the third quartile and is divided by a line, the median. The "whiskers" show the values outside of the central 50\%. The boxplots (Figure \ref{fig:A}, Figure \ref{fig:E} and Figure \ref{fig:gsw}) show that the control trees had significantly higher values than the treated trees (p-value$<10^{-5}$). 

The median of \textit{A} values for the controls was about 9 $\mu mol m^{-2} s^{-1}$, whereas the median for the cooled trees was less than 5 $\mu mol m^{-2}s^{-1}$ (Figure \ref{fig:A}).

    \label{fig:A}
\end{figure}

The median of \textit{E} values for the controls is about $2x10^{-3}$ $mol m^{-2}s^{-1}$, while the median for the treated trees is about $5x10^-4$ $molm^{-2}s^{-1}$ (Figure \ref{fig:E}).

    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/E.png}
    \caption{\textit{Evapotranspiration rate in control and cooled trees.}}
    \label{fig:E}
\end{figure}

The median of \textit{gsw} values for the controls was about 0.14 $mol m^{-2}s^{-1}$, whereas the median for the cooled trees was less than 0.05 $mol m^{-2}s^{-1}$ (Figure \ref{fig:gsw}).

    \label{fig:gsw}
\end{figure}

Photosynthetic efficiency was also significantly different in control trees and treated trees, however the p-value was higher (0.007). There was a significant difference among the batches as well (p-value=0.04): only batch 4 had significantly different values between the two groups (0.01), whereas for the other two batches, the p-values were higher than 0.05. Boxplot \ref{fig:A-Ci} shows that control trees have higher values than treated trees, but the medians of the two groups are closer to one another (0.03 $mol m^{-2} s{-1}$ for the controls and about 0.02 $mol m^{-2} s{-1}$ for the treated trees).

    \caption{\textit{Photosynthetic efficiency in control and cooled trees.}}
    \label{fig:A-Ci}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Effect of soil temperature on leaf gas exchange} \label{sec:second}
Having established that the cooled trees have significantly lower values for the gas exchange variables, the second part of the analysis adds to the first part by focusing on the impact of low soil temperatures (explanatory variable) on the leaf gas exchange variables (response variables). The impact on the \textit{A}, \textit{E} and \textit{gsw} proved to be significant, as shown by the p-values for the slope of the model. 
\smallskip

The relationship between \textit{A} and soil temperature had a p-value=$3x10^{-5}$ for the slope of the model. All batches show a decrease in $CO_2$ assimilation as temperature decreases (Figure \ref{fig:A2}. However, there is a significant difference among the batches as well (p-value=0.04): they are all significant individually, but batch 4 has the lowest p-value (0.009), with the cooled trees values being closer to one another and less scattered. Another noticeable characteristic of the plot is that \textit{A} values for control trees get progressively lower as time passes and as the growing season progress, with batch 1 - which was measured earlier in the season - having the highest values, and batch 4 having the lowest values. 

\begin{figure}[H]

\graphicspath{ {./images/} }
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{images/A2.png}
    \caption{\textit{The scatter plot shows the effect of soil temperature on $CO_2$ assimilation.

All batches show an increase as temperature increases.}}
    \label{fig:A2}
\end{figure}

Soil temperature had a significant effect on \textit{E}, with a p-value$<2x10^{-16}$ (Figure \ref{fig:E2}). The individual batches are all significant. Batch 1 has the highest control values here as well.

\begin{figure}[H]

    \caption{\textit{The scatter plot shows the effect of soil temperature on the $H_2O$ evapotraspiration rate. All batches show an increase as temperature increases.}}
    \label{fig:E2}
\end{figure}

The scatter plot representing the effect of soil temperature on \textit{gsw} shows a similar trend to the previous plot, with the same p-value. 

\begin{figure}[H]

\graphicspath{ {./images/} }
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{images/gsw2.png}
    \caption{\textit{The scatter plot shows the effect of soil temperature on the stomatal conductance. All batches show an increase as temperature increases.}}
    \label{fig:gsw2}
\end{figure}

These last two plots show the clearest relationship between response variable and explanatory variable. The cooled trees have lower, less scattered values than the cooled trees values for A, creating steeper slopes. % quantify that with percentages?
\smallskip

The relationship between \textit{$A/C_i$} and soil temperature is significant when considering all three batches (p=0.03), but the the relationship with each individual batch is not significant (the p-values are 0.19, 0.42 and 0.06 for batch 1, 2 and 4, respectively), as a lot of the cooled trees have high photosynthetic efficiency values (Figure \ref{fig:A_over_Ci2}).

    \caption{\textit{The scatter plot shows the effect of soil temperature on photosynthetic efficiency. The individual batches do not show a significant increase as temperature increases.}}
    \label{fig:A_over_Ci2}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Effect of water potential on leaf gas exchange} \label{sec:third}
The third part of the analysis looked at the water potential data. Firstly, the effect of soil temperature on water potential was examined using a gamma distribution model. With a p-value=0.446, the relationship was not significant.    
\smallskip

A further analysis was made to establish whether water potential affected the four gas exchange variables. Here, the explanatory variable (water potential) had a significant impact on \textit{A}, \textit{E} and \textit{gsw}: the gas exchange variables increased as water potential decreased.
The relationship between \textit{A} values and water potential can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:A3_full} (p-value=0.002 for the slope of the model).

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering 
\graphicspath{ {./images/} }
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/A3_full.png}
    \caption{\textit{Relationship between \textit{A} (response variable) and water potential (explanatory variable). $CO_2$ assimilation increases as water potential decreases.}}
    \label{fig:A3_full}
\end{figure}

A second plot (Figure \ref{fig:A3}) shows that control trees and treated trees were affected differently by the change in water potential. \textit{A} values in control trees increase significantly as water potential decreases (p-value=0.008), whereas \textit{A} values in treated trees are stable.

    \caption{\textit{Relationship between \textit{A} (response variable) and water potential (explanatory variable), with a distinction made between control trees (violet) and cooled trees (yellow).}}
    \label{fig:A3}
\end{figure}

Similar results can be found for \textit{E} values (Figure \ref{fig:E3} and \textit{gsw} values (Figure \ref{fig:gsw3}), which both increase significantly as water potential decreases (p-value are 0.008 and 0.004, respectively).

    \label{fig:gsw3}
\end{figure}

Finally, the plot representing the effect of water potential on photosynthetic efficiency shows a decrease of $A/C_i$ in control trees as water potential decreases (p-value=0.006), however the individual batches were not significantly affected (p-values>0.05).

\section{Discussion and conclusion}

The first part of the analysis showed cooled trees had significantly lower values than control trees for all four gas exchange variables, which sustains the first hypothesis suggested in the Aim of the thesis. In the second part of the analysis, it was % rileggi tutto, riprendi cose già dette prima e concludi. aggiungi parte su KW e A/Ci

We can conclude that $CO_2$ net assimilation, $H_2O$ evapotranspiration and stomatal conductance are all negatively affected by low soil temperature. Photosynthetic efficiency appears to not be significantly affected. Therefore, the role of non-stomatal limitation seems to have been marginal in affecting the rate of photosynthesis. 

The reason why batch 1 has a steeper slope and higher gas exchange values might be because it was measured earlier in the growing season, when photosynthetic activity is usually higher. % source

The results for the third part of the analysis are difficult to explain, as they contradict the initial hypothesis. It is possible that another factor that was not taken into consideration might have had an impact on the control trees (but not on the cooled trees), causing the increase of the gas exchange values and/ or interacting with the water potential. % rewrite

This is to be expected, given the close relation between the two variables. % refers to E and gsw vs soil temperature (same pvalue, similar plots)

The third part of the analysis looked at the water potential data. The hypothesis that was made in the Aim of Thesis (\ref{sec:aim}) was that hydraulic conductance, and thus water potential as well, would be negatively affected by soil cooling, showing a decrease as soil temperature dropped.

gas exchange variables increased as water potential decreased, which is an unexpected result, as lower water potential values indicates a stressed plant. %source
